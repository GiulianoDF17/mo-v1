Project: music-organizer-v1. A project to collect audio files.
Authors: David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 4.

To start:

Create a MusicOrganizer object on the object bench.
Use its methods to add, show, and remove files.

Questions:
1. The numbering is because of the order you filed the audio files in. Which means, once you delete audio file 0 then audio file 1 because audio file 0.
2. Nothing happens I get no error whatsoever, since there's none (audio files) added.
3. Yes it's what I expected as mentioned before. Since I removed audio file 0, then audio file 1 got jumped to audio file 0, so once you call the audio file 0 it becomes it's output is audio file 1.
